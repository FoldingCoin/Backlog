# EPIC - Create Simple Folding Installer

Installing FAH and configuring to receive FLDC, CURE, etc. can be difficult and will immediately turn off a large percentage of people.
If there is a way we can provide an installer that make the process a breeze then our on-boarding process is much easier.

## Dependencies

Need to get feedback from user experience group

## Assumptions & Risk

## Non-Functional Requirements

Needs to be easy to install and configure, allows a default configuration

## Functional Requirements

Installs FAH
Configures the client for the user
