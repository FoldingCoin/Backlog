# EPIC - Use File Hosting For File Storage

We should move from using a sql database for file hosting to file hosting

## Dependencies

None

## Assumptions & Risk

Any assumptions that are made and their corresponding risks

## Non-Functional Requirements

The non-functional requirements that must be satisified to complete this epic

## Functional Requirements

File storage service being used

Sql database being used but only to track downloads

API provides back-dated data and can be called at api.mergedfolding.net

We currently use the sql database to store the data. This is costly and slow, therefore the files should never be entirely stored in the sql database and should use file storage like [azure files](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/files/)

The files can stay compressed to save on costs and the API will decompress them and read them into memory. This may still take some time but we can cache the files if it becomes a problem, it'll eventually return quickly.

Use the sql database to keep track of the files and their state because we still want to validate the files on download, we can always reprocess them to validate them before they will be considered by the API

Move the daily download service to run under the API service instead of a full windows server
