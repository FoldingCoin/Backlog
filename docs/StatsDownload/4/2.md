# Update Download Service Implementation

The download service should be updated to store the files in file storage

## Dependencies

V2 Database Scheme

## Additional Information

Update to store files to file storage

The states should be identical to what they are now

Upload the files compressed

## Acceptance Criteria

Download file

Ensure file is in file storage and still compressed

Ensure file errors are caught, logged, and configured users are notified

## Assumptions & Risk

Any assumptions that are made and their corresponding risks

## Dev Notes

Sample code for file storage

            // in an environment variable on the machine running the application called storageconnectionstring.
            // If the environment variable is created after the application is launched in a console or with Visual
            // Studio, the shell or application needs to be closed and reloaded to take the environment variable into account.
