# Add File Validation to Download Service

After the file download has occurred, we should validate the file is valid before accepting it and using it for stats

## Dependencies

## Additional Information

After a file download has completed, we should identify all files ready for validation and validate them
We should validate that we can decompress the file, read the header information, and there are no major errors (there are some badly formatted lines in the correct file currently)
We should rename the file to the file's date-time, if there is a collision, then this file should error with the reasoning
