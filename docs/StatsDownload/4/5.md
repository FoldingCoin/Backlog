# Cache Files for Quick Access on Repeated Calls

When the API is called it may receive the same or similar call very soon so we should cache the recently used files

## Dependencies

API Updates

## Additional Information

Cache recently downloaded files in the decompressed state (this could really just be the parsed data we care about)
This should clear after a minimum 12 hours, max 24, and every morning after the daily download (where possible and reasonable; may defer to minor release)

## Acceptance Criteria

Call the API twice
Second call to API should not produce a call to the file server

## Assumptions & Risk

None
