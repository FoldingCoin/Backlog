# EPIC - Automate Daily Off-Chain Distributions

As a user of the FLDC network, I want my rewards provided to me in the offchain system regularly.  I don't want to have to wait on a weekly manual process in order to pull out my rewards.

As a FoldingCoin administrator, I don't want to have to manually initiate an offchain distribution regularly.

In addition to providing the automated functionality, we should provide feedback to the admins about the status of each daily distribution.  There are plenty of reasons for a daily distribution to fail, such as not enough FLDC being present in the escrow address.
